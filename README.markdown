Odroid-C1 Display Service for [CloudI](http://cloudi.org)
=========================================================

Currently only the [16x2 LCD display](http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G141637550797) is supported.
This example shows how CloudI can isolate C dependencies for hardware so
higher-level data processing can run decoupled (keeping the fault-tolerance
constraints on both pieces of source code separate).
